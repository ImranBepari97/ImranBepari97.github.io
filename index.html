                    <p>
                        I am a Software Engineer from the University of Southampton. This site is dedicated to showcasing my projects and experience so you can get a better idea of who I am.
						<br/> <br/>
						Mainly, I've done work in Virtual Reality, Cybersecurity and general Software Engineering. I've also dabbled in Web Development a bit, this site being evidence of that. 
						<br/> <br/>
						My main programming language of choice is Java, since I'm most proficient at it. I'm also experienced with engines such as Unity and Unreal Engine 4, as part of games and VR development.

				<h3>BAE Systems Applied Intelligence</h3>
				<span class="education-date">June 2018 - Sept 2018</span>
				<h4>Software Engineer Intern</h4>
				<p>
					Completed a 12-week software engineer internship, where I worked on a client-based project. The project involved remaking a pre-existing system, maintaining functionality but becoming much more efficient and maintainable.
					<ul>
					  <li>Used Java and Maven extensively during the project. The project was made extending Apache NiFi to process, enrich and aggregate data.</li>
					  <li>Lead the intern team on Agile and Source Control, aided by JIRA. My team had no prior programming experience, so I generally aided them with programming concepts and Git.</li>
					  <li>Gained project management skills, with tools such as Enterprise Architect.</li>
					</ul>

				<h3>Personal Best Education - NCS Hants</h3>
				<span class="education-date">July 2016 – Sept 2017</span>
				<h4>Team Leader</h4>
				<p>
					After undertaking NCS’ The Challenge at the end of my school years, I reapplied on a similar NCS program as a staff member.
					
					<ul>
					  <li>Had to lead and be responsible for a team of twelve 16 year olds as they carried out the programme.</li>
					  <li>Often had to work independently whilst being responsible for other people, requiring me to exercise leadership skills, ability to compromise and efficiency.</li>

            <span class="education-date">Sept 2015 - Aug 2019</span>
            <h4>Master of Engineering in Computer Science - 1st Class</h4>
            <p>
                I'm currently in my final year of study. So far, I'm aiming for a First Class Degree. My time at University has been the foundation of my learning and the base of my Computer Science knowledge.
				<br/><br/>
				During my time, I was heavily involved in societies, mainly the Southampton University Mixed Martial Arts (SUMMA) Society. I mainly practise Brazilian Jiu Jitsu and Muay Thai. More related to Computer Science, I've taken part in Hackathons extremely frequently. 
				<br/><br/>
				As a STEM Ambassador, I also took part in teaching children in primary schools how to code, as part of the CodePlus programme, run by the University. In this role, I would teach a large group of 8 - 11 year olds the basics of programming and Computer Science, as a class lead. 
				<br/><br/>
				
				<ul>
					<li> Achieved 80% on my dissertation, details can be found below. </li>
					<li> Performed well in highly technical modules, involving programming, cybersecurity and engineering. </li>
					<li> Other content can be found within CV and projects below. </li>

                        <p>
                            In C#, this modding project is the significant template for the Gorn Modding community. After a long time of being unable to create two handed weapons, this template allows developers to add their own Two Handed weapons into the game! This template was released for all developers to use, for free.
							<br> </br>
							Gorn is a Virtual Reality game, developed by Freelives. It's a gladiator game, where you fight other gladiators in an arena. Best described as a power trip.

                        <p>
                            During Summer of 2018, I took part in HackXLR8 2018. This was a Hackathon Event hosted by Digi.Me, focused on creating applications that use your personal data in an ethical way. My team won the Hackathon, bagging us a £2000 prize and interest to turn the application into a potential startup.
							<br> </br>
							The application made was a Fitness application focused around making exercise more accessible for people with disabilities, by using data such as what medication they took and illnesses they had.
